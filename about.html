                  Born into a family of artists, Kanchanamala Kampli was
                  introduced to art at a very young age. K G Somashekar, her
                  father, a much celebrated artist and photographer par
                  excellence, was a major artistic influence in her life. Great
                  masters such as Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Salvador
                  Dali, Shapansky, S.M. Pandit, Kathe Kollwitz, Robert Lango
                  also influenced her and eventually she took up the study of
                  Fine Arts.

                Her painting sees her draw upon a deep inspiration of
                Surrealists, Cubists as well as the Folk Visual Arts of India.
                This unique combination is vivid, dramatic, true, contemplative
                and portrays a great sense of maturity and balance. Haunting and
                poignant, each work will remain with you for one reason or
                another. The colours of one might speak to you while on another
                the bare nakedness of thought will provoke a reaction. The
                interesting use of textures, smooth and edgy in turns, displays
                her strong grasp of taste and technique. A visual treat at one
                level, there is more than just a visual display on show here.

                Her pencil portraits and charcoal sketches will take your breath
                away. Not only are they extraordinarily faithful to the subject,
                but each stroke seems to carry the touch of the sensitive artist
                and bear witness to her poetic and insightful mastery over
                characterization, where light and shade get fused into speaking,
                moist eyes at times or make the furrows etched into the lines of
                another face come alive on paper! Her work is exhibited at
                International Art Exhibitions in Europe, North America and The
                Middle East by Burland Galleries, London
                (www.burlandgalleries.com)

                Art lovers take pride in including her work in their personal
                collections. Her 3-year stint as Assistant Conservator at the
                Regional Conservation Laboratory, Mysore added to her growing
                experience. As part of her work, she undertook the restoration
                of Oils, Watercolours, Papers, Manuscripts, Animal Skin, Metal
                Objects, Coins, Kadathas and Murals.
